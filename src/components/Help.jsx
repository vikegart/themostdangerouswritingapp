      <h2>What's the point?</h2>
      <p>The Most Dangerous Writing App is designed to shut down your inner editor and get you into a state of flow. If you stop typing for more than five seconds, all progress will be lost. After typing without interruption for the length of your session, you'll be able to save your work.</p>
      <p>Because 'tis better to have written and lost, than never to have written at all.</p>
